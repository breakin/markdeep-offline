                      **Markdeep Feature Demo**
                           Morgan McGuire

This demonstration documents the features of
[Markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep) and acts as a test for
it.  Markdeep is a text formatting syntax that extends Markdown, and a
Javascript program for making it work in browsers. The two most
powerful features are its ability to run in any **web browser** on the
client side and the inclusion of **diagrams**.

[Click here](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/features.md.html?noformat)
to see this document without automatic formatting.

Markdeep is free and easy to use. It doesn't need a plugin, or
Internet connection. There's nothing to install. Just start
writing in Vi, Nodepad, Zed, Emacs, Visual Studio, Atom, or another
editor! You don't have to export, compile, or otherwise process
your document.

If you want to support development of Markdeep, just buy my
[Graphics Codex](http://graphicscodex.com) book for $10 on Amazon. Revenue from that funds my
open source projects.

Basic Formatting
=======================================================================================
Text formatting: 

    Source                               |     Result
-----------------------------------------|------------------------------
`**bold**`                               | **bold**
`__bold__`                               | __bold__
`*italic*`                               | *italic*
`_italic_`                               | _italic_
`~~strikethrough~~`                      | ~~strikethrough~~
<code>`inline code`</code>               | `inline code`
`5 kg/m^3`                               | 5 kg/m^3

You can add CSS to change the styles. See the Custom Formatting section
for some examples.

Formatted text may **cross
lines** and be as small as **a** single character. It can _also
  be indented and
  split across lines_ simultaneously.

Markdeep intelligently does not apply bold or italic formatting to
math expressions such as x = 3 * y - 2 * z or WORDS_WITH_INTERNAL_UNDERSCORES.
It also protects HTML `<tags>` in code blocks from disappearing.

If you _want_ italics or bold inside of a word, for example in: SCUBA = <b>S</b>elf <b>C</b>ontained
<b>U</b>nderwater <b>B</b>reathing <b>A</b>pparatus, then just use HTML `<b>` and `<i>`
tags---a markdown syntax won't be any more readable in that case.

Exponents only work for positive and negative integers. For arbitrary exponents,
use LaTeX notation: `$x^y$` ==> $x^y$, or HTML tags: `x<sup>y</sup>` ==> x<sup>y</sup>.

Links
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many forms of implicit and explicit links:


         Source                            |   Result
-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
`[hyperlink](http://casual-effects.com)`   | [hyperlink](http://casual-effects.com)
`[hyperlink]("http://casual-effects.com")` | [hyperlink]("http://casual-effects.com")
`<http://casual-effects.com>`              | <http://casual-effects.com> 
`http://casual-effects.com`                | http://casual-effects.com
`morgan@casual-effects.com`                | morgan@casual-effects.com
`test@foo.co.uk`                           | test@foo.co.uk
`<test@foo.co.uk>`                         | <test@foo.co.uk>
`Lists section`                            | Lists section
`Tiny Grids subsection`                    | Tiny Grids subsection
`Section [Lists]`                          | Section [Lists]
`sec. [lists]`                             | sec. [lists]
`subsection [lists]`                       | subsection [lists]
`table [states]`                           | table [states]
`tbl. [states]`                            | tbl. [states]
`Table [states]`                           | Table [states]
`figure [robot]`                           | figure [robot]
`fig. [robot]`                             | fig. [robot]
`Figure [robot]`                           | Figure [robot]
`lst. [sort]`                              | lst. [sort]
`listing [sort]`                           | listing [sort]
`Listing [sort]`                           | Listing [sort]
`[New York Times][nyt]`                    | [New York Times][nyt]
`[Google][]`                               | [Google][]
`footnote [^syntax]`                       | footnote [^syntax]
`[#Kajiya86]`                              | [#Kajiya86]

Any section header name followed by "section", "subsection", or "sec." will automatically be
linked to that section. To link by number, use one of those key words followed by the section
name in brackets. This won't work if you use the actual word "section" _as the title of a
section_...but it would be unexpected to have a section named "section" in a real document
anyway.

You can also insert HTML anchor (`<a>`) tags to create arbitrary internal links.

Reference-style links include arbitrary formatted text in brackets
followed by a case-insensitive symbolic name that must be defined
elsewhere in the document:

- Example using a symbolic name: [New York Times][nyt]
- Example using the text as its own symbol: [Google][]

Put the definitions at a convenient location elsewhere in the document:

~~~~~~~~~~~~none
    [nyt]: http://nytimes.com
    [google]: http://google.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Markdeep also supports footnotes, endnotes [^syntax], and citations
[#Kajiya86] using a similar syntax. The actual notes and bibliography
may be placed at the bottom of the document:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~none
    [#Kajiya86]: James T. Kajiya. 1986 ...

    [^syntax]: Endnotes look like ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regular links may also have attributes, for example,
[this link will directly download](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/robot.jpg download).

URLs in explicit links may be surrounded by optional `"` quotation `"` marks. If your URL
contains parentheses, then it _must_ be surrounded in quotation marks to make it unambigious:

- [a link with parens]("http://casual-effects.com(bar)")
- []("http://casual-effects.com(bar)")

URLs with various forms of special characters are handled well even without quotation marks:

- [hyperlinks to URLs with underscores](https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1_djvu.txt)
- https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1_djvu.txt

You can also use the CommonMark angle bracket syntax
`<http://foo.com/bar?arg=value&hello>` ==>
<http://foo.com/bar?arg=value&hello> provided that your URL only
contains lower-case letters. Otherwise the browser interprets it
as a tag and converts it to lowercase before Markdeep runs.

[^syntax]: Endnotes look like reference-style links with an empty text
field. Endnotes may not contain multiple paragraphs (sorry, David
Foster Wallace), although they may refer to _other_ endnotes.

Lists
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A blank line or line ending in a colon must precede lists. Lists have lines that begin with a
number (which is not required to increment) and a period, or a bullet character (-, *, +). They
can also be nested. Example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Monday
2. Tuesday
  1. Morning
  2. Afternoon
3. Wednesday
  - Bullets
  - Bullets
1. Thursday
  + Bullets
  + Bullets
1. Friday
  * Bullets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples of lists and floating diagrams:
                                                   *****************************
1. Monday                                          *   A         B         C   *
2. Tuesday                                         *   *-------->o<------->o   *
  1. Morning                                       *   ^        / ^        |   *
  2. Afternoon                                     *   |       v   \       v   *
3. Wednesday                                       *   o----->o---->o<---->*   *
  - Bullets                                        *   D      E     F      G   *
  - Bullets                                        *****************************
4. Thursday
5. Friday


A list with just bullets:
- Bread
- Fish
- Milk
- Cheese


A  list containing a code block:

1. This is the first list item.

   ~~~~~~
   // This is a code block
   if (x > 0) printf("hello!\n");
   ~~~~~~
   
1. This is the second list item.


- Level 1
 - Level 2
  - Level 3
- Level 1 again


- 1
 - 1.a
  - 1.a.i
  - 1.a.ii
 - 1.b

Lists can also:

* Use asterisks
* Instead of
* Minus signs
* `or have code`
* *and* other formatting

or

+ Use plus
+ Signs


Lists with blank lines between the elements are formatted with more spacing. There's actually
nothing special about this...that's just the regular paragraph separator.


1. Here's a list with some large elements that I chose to format by putting a blank line
   between the elements to make them more visually distinguished.

2. That's necessary with paragraph-sized elements; otherwise the
   text would appear to run together into a wall of text!
    
   - You can also
   - Nest lists within lists with spaces


Lists that begin with a number other than 1 use that number as the start index. The subsequent
numbers are irrelevant and automatically replaced with ascending numbers:

6. A list that starts at six!
1. and just
1. keeps going...

Definition Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apple
:   Pomaceous fruit of plants of the genus Malus in 
    the family Rosaceae.

    Multiple paragraphs are supported.

Orange
:   The fruit of an evergreen tree of the genus Citrus.

    - Can also
    - Put lists
    - In definitions

Definition lists with short definitions are formatted more tersely:

Grapes
: Available in purple ("red") and green ("white") varieties.

Bananas
: Only yellow.

Schedule Lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Schedule lists contain titles that begin with a valid date. After the
title, arbitrary indented content appears, including lists, text, and
equations:

~~~~~~~~~~~~none
Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch
 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system
 
Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone
 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed
                  ⋮

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed
~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the schedule is sufficiently long and dense, then a calendar preview
is shown before it. Entries in parenthesis with no further details
are formatted with a more subtle style.

Formatted schedule lists
look like:

Tuesday Feb 16, 2016: Project Launch
 - Create specifications
 - Initialize revision control system

Friday Feb 19, 2016: Build Milestone
 - Build system fully functional
 - Placeholder unit tests committed
 
 _Plan for weekend overtime if we miss this milestone_
 
Wednesday Feb 24, 2016: Site Visit
 **Whole team vistits client**. Dress appropriately.

Friday Feb 26, 2016: Demo Milestone
 - Internal demonstrations for management
 - QA reports due

(Monday Feb 29, 2016): Office Closed

Tuesday Mar 1, 2016: Code Freeze
 - Commit final features before this date
 - Only priority 1 fixes with issue tracking numbers
   after this point

Monday Mar 7, 2016: Beta

Wednesday Mar 16, 2016: Gold

Dates can be in any unambigous format that includes a month, day, and
four-digit year between 1000 and 2999, such as:

- 2001-03-01
- 1 Apr. 1999
- 4-07-1976
- February 16, 2016
- 2020 Jan. 15
- May 15th, 1982

The US date format MM/DD/YYYY is not supported because it is
ambiguous. The date may include the name of a day of the week
(e.g., Sunday). It will be replaced with the correct day.

When months are given by name, they must match the localization
settings.


Block Quotes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Email-style indenting creates a blockquote:

> This is an indented blockquote: Ut at felis diam. Aliquam massa odio, pharetra ut neque sed, commodo
> dignissim orci. Curabitur quis velit gravida, blandit diam nec,
> lacinia quam. Maecenas pharetra, velit in vestibulum auctor, diam
> ipsum suscipit arcu, non sodales orci nibh sit amet leo. Nulla dictum

Blockquotes formatted in the style of an actual quotation receive
special treatment for fancy quoting:

> "You want to make it seem alive and effortless and fun, but that's an
> art that took me 25 years to really learn. I wanted to do it very much
> 25 years ago, but I didn't know how."
>
>      -- David O. Russell, director of American Hustle

Page Breaks
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To support other markdown conventions, `\pagebreak` and `\newpage` will insert a page break in
a document when printed or converted to PDF. You can also use a pattern of a series of five `+`
signs on their own line, which will form a horizontal rule on screen and a new page when
printed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To make top-level section headers also force page breaks, add the following to your
document or CSS file:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
&lt;style&gt;.md h1, .md .nonumberh1 {page-break-before:always}&lt;/style&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Images and Video
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There's no natural way to embed an image into a document that is also readable as plain
text. Markdeep follows markdown's somewhat reasonable syntax.  The source

`      ![A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)` 

becomes:

![A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)

Optional labels may be applied:

`      ![Figure [robot]: A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)` 

![Figure [robot]: A picture of a robot](robot.jpg)

Any text after the URL is used as HTML attributes. If the attributes
include width or height specifications, then the image is linked to
the original.

````
![Figure [robot2]: A picture of a robot with a caption larger
than it.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")
````

![Figure [robot2]: A picture of a robot with a caption larger
than it.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Really long captions are justified, not centered. This happens automatically when the caption spans multiple lines. You can also use custom CSS to change the formatting of captions.](robot.jpg width="150px" border="1")

![Floating robot with a large caption.](robot.jpg width="20%") If the image is embedded in a
paragraph and has a caption, then it floats right and any width
specification is propagated to the full captioned image, for example, 
the image to the right of this paragraph. Use a space as your caption
if you want this behavior but don't actually want a visible caption.

You can also just use a raw HTML `<img>` tag: 

`       <img src="robot.jpg" width="128" border="2"/>`

<img src="robot.jpg" width="128" border="2"/>

<!-- Markdeep: --><script src="markdeep.min.js"></script>
